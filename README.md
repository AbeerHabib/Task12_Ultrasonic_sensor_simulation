# Ultrasonic_sensor_simulation


I designed an electronic circuit to control the reception robot, the robot aims to interacts with the user so that it welcomes him by moving its hands and interacting through its face, after that the user will chatting with the robot (chatbot), at the end of the robot asks the user to evaluate his performance.

This electrical circuit enables the robot to sense the presence of a human at a distance of 100 cm or less, if it senses the presence of a human, the robot's screen will turn on and the robot will move its hands in a certain movement.

In other words, the ultrasonic sensor senses someone at a distance of 0 cm or less then it gives a signal to the servo motors to move with a certain movement, and also gives a signal to the bluetooth module to sends a bluetooth message to turn on the screen.

Electrical circuit components:

1- arduino microcontroller

2- bluetooth module (instead i used a led and connect it to the arduino)

3- breadboard

4- ultrasonic sensor

5- servo motors

The robot hands are supposed to perform a certain movement, but I only made the motors move to an angle of 90 without making a certain movement just to make sure the ultrasonic sensor works well.
