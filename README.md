# Ultrasonic_sensor_simulation


I designed an electronic circuit to control the reception robot, the robot aims to interacts with the user so that it welcomes him by moving his hands and interacting through his face, after that the user will chatting with the robot (chatbot), at the end of the robot asks the user to evaluate his performance.

This electrical circuit enables the robot to sense the presence of an object at a distance of 200 cm or less, if it senses the presence of an object, the robot's screen will turn on and the robot will move one of his arms. 

In detailes, the ultrasonic senses someone at a distance of 200 cm or less then it gives a signal to the servo motors to move with a certain movement, and also gives a signal to the bluetooth module to sends a bluetooth message to turn on the screen.

Electrical circuit components:

1- arduino microcontroller

2- bluetooth module (instead i used arduino)

3- breadboard

4- ultrasonic sensor

5- servo motors

I used an arduino instead of the bluetooth module and to make sure it works I connected it to a LED.
